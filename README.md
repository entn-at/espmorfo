Spanish Morphological Analysis Tools

This repository contains lexical and morphological rule files and Python code
for a set of tools to extract word-level features from Spanish language text.
The tools can be used to label verb person, mood, and tense; noun or adjective
gender and number; to derive a word’s root noun or verb infinitive (via the
lemmatizer); and to convert verbs to their nominal form (via the nominalizer).
